# Ballistic Missile Simulation Visualization

This project aims to create visualizations of ballistic missile simulations using Python. The simulation allows users to input the initial velocity and launch angle, which are then used to generate visualizations of the ballistic missile trajectory in the form of graphs. The visualizations include vertical velocity vs time, kinetic energy vs time, horizontal vs vertical trajectory, and altitude vs time. This project can be used for educational purposes or to demonstrate the physics concepts of projectile motion.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, you will need Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository and run the `ballistic_missile_simulation.py` file. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the initial velocity and launch angle.
